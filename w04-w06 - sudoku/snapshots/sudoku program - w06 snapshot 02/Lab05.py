MAIN AND UI MODULES

Description: Play Sudoku!
What was the hardest part?
- The DUMBEST little bug - my program wasn't displaying the 
    user's changes... I wasn't sure if it was even editing the board.
    The fix was changing the return value of 'get_combined_board'
    from 'board' to 'combined_board'. My program was working all along!
- Another bug: after editing, and after, editing my board, unless 
    saving within the program, my user_board would revert to its 
    original values... I realized I never put a return value for 
    user_board for neither 'prompt' nor 'try filling square'. 
    I put a return value in, and then voil√°! :)

How long did it take for you to complete the assignment?
- 2 hours
