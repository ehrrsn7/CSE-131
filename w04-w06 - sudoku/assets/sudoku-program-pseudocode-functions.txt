PARAM:  input (string)
RETURN: is valid (boolean)

// handle incorrect length
IF input length IS NOT 2: RETURN FALSE

/** handle incorrect format **/
// first value not a character
IF first character in string IS NOT type character: RETURN FALSE

// character value not in range
IF first character in string IS NOT in range [A>>I]: RETURN FALSE

// second value not a character
IF second character in string IS NOT type integer: RETURN FALSE

// integer value not in range
IF second character in string IS NOT in range [1>>9]: RETURN FALSE

ELSE: (all conditions met)
    RETURN TRUE

* Sudoku Rule Nº 1:
* There is no more than one instance of a given number on a given row.

// validate by row
FOR cell numbers in row:
    IF desired value IS cell number: RETURN FALSE

* Sudoku Rule Nº 2:
* There is no more than one instance of a given number on a given column.

* Sudoku Rule Nº 3:
* Every square can consist of a single digit between 1 and 9 exclusively, or can be blank.
